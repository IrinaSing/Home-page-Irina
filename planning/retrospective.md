# Retrospective

<!--
  compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board
  how different was your planned tasks from what you actually built?
  building something very different from your plan is not a bad thing!
  what counts is that you learn from your mistakes and make a better plan next time.
-->

I did not use Project board at all, but I can say that my code is different from the Development strategy. Development strategy was based on Figma layout (general look and style parameters). But in my work I used Bootstrap, which names of classes, default styles are quite specific. The nxt step is to customize default framework styles to my design.

I like the workflow without using project board and issues as far as I work on my own.
