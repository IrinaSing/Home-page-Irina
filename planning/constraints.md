# Constraints

## External

- One week to finish the project including design in figma, creation of content, coding.

- I am new to Figma.

## Internal: Voluntary

- **Non-original design.** I can use other websites as inspiration for my own web design.
- **Simple design** is also a solution. Minimum effects and clear minimalistic appearance. 
- **CSS framework usage** to reach my goal in a faster way. I have chosen Bootstrap framework, because
  it is a big library, very popular( so there are many tutorials), it is easy-to-use and to implement even for juniors. Also contains Java-Script plugins. Realy good for mobile-first, responsive websites.
- **One-page website.** I will make a simple one-page website. It is enough for now.
- **No animation, no JS**
