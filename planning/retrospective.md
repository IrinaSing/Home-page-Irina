# Retrospective

<!--
  compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board
  how different was your planned tasks from what you actually built?
  building something very different from your plan is not a bad thing!
  what counts is that you learn from your mistakes and make a better plan next time.
-->

I did not use Project board at all, but I can say that my code is different from the Development strategy. Development strategy was based on Figma layout (general look and style parameters). But in my work I used Bootstrap, which names of classes, default styles are quite specific. The next step is to customize default framework styles to my design.

I like the workflow without using project board and issues as far as I work on my own.

Page turned out to be quite similar to Figma layout.

## Continue Doing

<!--
  what did your group that worked vwell
  agree to keep doing these in the next project
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - making small, well-named commits
  - using the `help-wanted` label
-->

- Using Figma and Bootstrap. Watching more tutorials and practicing more.
- Author of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9B4TPnak1A) has few helpful tutorials on Bootstrap 5.

## Start Doing

<!--
  what ideas does your group have for making a better project next time?
  agree to give these things a try in the next projec
  this could be about anything. communication, code, review, ...
  examples (be specific!):
  - use @mentions more often
  - use the github integration in slack. /github
-->

- To create live prototypes of websites in Figma. Definitely must have.

## Lessons Learned

<!--
  what cool things or general lessons has your team learned?
  This can be about anything! code, collaboration, git, github, ...
-->

- Using CSS framework for the first time.
- Figma interface and functions.
- UI/UX principles on practice.
- Responsiveness of the website.
